        <h1>Consumption, resources, and the environment: What you need to know. (Like srsly)</h1>

            Alright pay attention people, did you already know Americans have been using a lot more copper lately? No? Well, between 1963 and 1996, our copper consumption doubled, and then it doubled again two decades later (Lesson 1) – talk about a copper craze! Interestingly, a big chunk of the copper we use isn't even from our mines; we're importing it from other countries because it's cheaper. Surprising, right? It turns out we're doing this to be environmentally conscious. People all over the US are saying no to more copper mining because of the potential risks to our environment. When reading about this, I found it a bit confusing at first – why not use our mines? But it started making sense after learning that it will have a negative impact on our environment. (Lesson 1) Exploring renewable resources, especially copper, feels like navigating a maze of potential environmental impacts.

            And speaking of environmental impacts. Let’s talk about water. While we're all trying to be water-saving heroes, there's a twist. Those innocent-looking dairy cows? They're gulping down nearly 16,000 liters of water to produce one liter of milk. And beef? Hold onto your hat; it takes the same amount of water to make one kilo! So, here's me contemplating a switch to soy milk, which sips on a mere 300 liters. And chocolate? Hold onto your sweet tooth – a whopping 17,000 liters for just one kilo! (Lesson 2) The more we learn, the more we're rethinking our beverage and snack choices.

            We’re not done yet, we’ve only just begun. In our sustainability stories, we time-travel to societies that struggled to adapt – kind of like trying to dance to a new beat without missing a step. Back in the day, everyone was just doing their thing, experimenting like it was one big sustainability test. Fast forward to the Renaissance, when folks started questioning and showing concerns for our world's sustainability. Sadly, those warnings were ignored. (Lesson 1) It makes you wonder – what if people had taken it seriously back then? Maybe we'd be living in a more sustainable world right now.

            Now when we talk about sustainability we have to take the environment into account. So, THEREFORE, I decided to play weather detective and check out the difference between extreme weather and climate change. It's like comparing a short story to a whole book series – both interesting, just on different scales. Imagine extreme weather events as the cool, attention-grabbing moments – the short bursts of drama featuring hurricanes and heat waves. Now, climate change is the slow-burning series, the one shaping the entire narrative quietly in the background. Guess who the storytellers are? Yup, it's us, the humans, pulling the strings with our greenhouse gases and fossil fuel choices. It's like we're directing the ultimate weather movie, where nature is the star. Now, let's switch gears to a horror movie analogy. Extreme weather events are the jump scares – sudden, heart-pounding moments like hurricanes and floods. Zoom out, and the entire movie is climate change – a long, ongoing story influenced by us, the audience. Just like a movie's vibe changes, our weather shifts as climate change takes its time. It's a real-life drama happening globally, giving us a front-row seat to see how it affects communities. Climate change is like the ultimate storyteller, gradually shaping the world over time. To really get what's going on, we need to peel back the layers, like unwrapping a mystery, short-term thrills and long-term sagas working together to give us the full picture of our evolving environment. When we peel back a layer, perhaps, we’re not just simple audience members but rather a more active member in this horror/mystery/thriller. We as humans have a far greater impact…mayhaps we are the monster lurking in the shadows. (Lesson 5 and Gov, Global Change)
