        <h1>Wood: the Pluses, the (not so much) Minuses, and the Neutrals</h1>
        <p>
            Alright, new day new blog. So listen up folks I feel that this is a very important thing to know because we use many variety of wood products. The video is right below.
        </p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1eWUby71Ew?si=ZCBDPG8I3wfu3ylz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            If y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want to watch. Let me tell you what I learned from it. So the video starts off with a loaded truck, and then the weighing processes determines the weight of the logs received. After unloaded by the crane, the empty truck returns for a second weighing, making accurate calculations of the logs' weight. And sustainability is their core focus throughout this milling process. (Lesson 13 - Collum‚Äôs Lumber Products)

            They get laser scanning technology for cutting and slicing wood while waste materials, like bark, are repurposed for industrial fuel. From debarking to sorting, each step is executed with precision which produces high-quality lumber and minimizing waste at the same time. Then, following the drying in the kiln, lumber is good for shipment. Sustainability and quality just intersect so seamlessly, there‚Äôs just something nice and satisfying about knowing that you know. (Lesson 13 - Collum‚Äôs Lumber Products)
        </p>

            Speaking of which. Another thing I got interested in was the Cross Laminated Timber (CLT). I was looking into some CLT buildings actually because I wanted to see what‚Äôs the most recent one and how it looks. There was one structure that stood out: the Ascent, nestled at 700 E Kilbourn Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53202. It was developed by New Land Enterprises, their construction began in 2020 and was completed in 2022. (Urban Milwaukee)
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Ascent isn't just a building though it's a fusion of architectural innovation and sustainability, REDEFINING urban living. An impressive height of 284 feet (87 meters labeled the tallest Timber for a reason) and spans 25 stories with 493,000 square feet of space. Now this is a towering symbol of modernity. Get this it‚Äôs all TIMBER. Not only aesthetic but also has environmental benefits. AND has 259 apartments, AND a sixth-floor pool, AND a penthouse amenity level. Ascent isn't just a residence at this point; it's an experience, elevating urban living to new heights (pun intended). (Project Ascent)

            So far the new things I‚Äôve learned were interesting. But carbon sequestration? Just the other day I had a little convo with somebody about it and you probably know who you are if you‚Äôre reading this. But you learn something new every day am I right? 
        </p>
        <p>
            They asked me if I knew that using wood for construction actually helps store carbon and reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. Me: No?... Them: Yeah, so trees absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, which is pretty neat. BUT when we harvest trees for wood products, stored carbon releases back into the atmosphere. SO, while wood construction can temporarily store carbon, we need to think about the whole life cycle of wood products. (Lesson 17)
        </p>
        <p>
            That means considering everything from extraction to disposal. It's important to know carbon neutrality over time. And when we compare wood to concrete or steel, we have to look at the big picture. Sure, wood has its perks, but sustainable forest management is just as important. If we keep our forests healthy it‚Äôll continue sequestering carbon and supporting ecosystems. End goal fights off climate change a bit. (Lesson 17)
        </p>
        <p>
            As we conclude our exploration of lumber production and sustainable construction, it's clear we've unearthed some intriguing new knowledge. From Collum‚Äôs Lumber Products to Ascent's eco-conscious design. The real eye-opener? Trees, our unsung carbon storage heroes. Wood offers undeniable benefits, sustainable forest management is essential to combat climate change.

            <h1>All feedstocks, bio-renewables included, have to be sourced from somewhere</h1>
            <p>
                We are going to focus on the source of all feedstocks and biorenewables today. Unbeknownst to most, bamboo is more than simply a massive green plant that sways in the wind. Its roots, or rhizomes, are the source of all its energy, making it a pretty good force in the energy department. Bamboo grows in two different ways: called clumping and running. What is that you ask? Clumping is where the bamboo grows tightly together. Running means bamboo spreads out and can take over large areas if not managed. When spring shows up the culms which are the visible stems on bamboo bloom quickly and reach their maximum height in just one growth season.  (Bamboo Biology)
            </p>
            <p>
                But here's where it gets interesting. If you were to decide to give a bamboo a trim, it won't sulk or waste time moping about its missing height. Nope, it's a very determined little fella. So, what happens is that the little cut bamboo will channel its energy like a first Hokage when he channels his chakra for wood-style jutsu into making fresh leaves. These fresh leaves then become these little supporters helping the plant generate more energy, which then travels down to the roots, triggering the growth of new bamboo shoots. Like a crazy green machine, ironic am I right? Haha. (Bamboo Facts) (peep my Naruto reference üëÄ) 
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyhow, bamboo can be found in both the warmer and cooler regions of Asia and South America, with a few in Australia, Africa, and the southern United States. Its biomass composition is probably the envy of other plants. Bamboo is a powerful renewable energy source, why? because of its combination of lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. This versatile plant isn't just a pretty face; it's a powerhouse of bioenergy potential. From charcoal to bioethanol and even biogas, bamboo stands tall as a sustainable source for our energy needs.

                Moving on from the bamboos, let‚Äôs talk about the monocultures of tree plantations. I was reading up on an article talking about the controversies of monoculture tree plantation. That‚Äôs when I thought not all sourcing of feedstocks and biorenewables have positive impacts. Like a bamboo does. So let‚Äôs dive into the bad side specifically with monocultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reading the article made me think these tree plantations come with a baggage of problems. There are lack of water supply which throws off ecosystems on both land and water out of whack. Imagine a deforestation and soil erosion playing tag in the environmental playground, it ain‚Äôt a pretty sight. (Negative Impacts)
            </p>
            <p>
                Socially, it's a community disturbance with native and Afro communities getting uprooted, leading to increased poverty and food security concerns. Not only that the biodiversity takes a hit too, thanks to the single-species planting party. It's like inviting only one type of guest to your party and expecting a diverse and lively crowd. It obvious it‚Äôs not happening. (Negative Impacts)
            </p>
            <p>
                Tree plantations are a source of anxiety despite their reputation for being able to accumulate carbon. Deforestation and the usage of agrochemicals are risks that could lead to the unintentional release of greenhouse gases, aggravating climate change. International targets that encourage the growth of plantations for wood-based bioenergy also make matters worse. Foreign companies frequently seize land as a result of this growth, uprooting local residents and disturbing long-standing farming methods. Like that‚Äôs just mean. (Negative Impacts)
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly, this article is like the 'Debbie Downer' of articles, it‚Äôs got many concerns and issues but also it has it‚Äôs biases. So take it with a grain of salt because monoculture tree plantation does have it‚Äôs own potential benefits not everything is bad. Just make sure y‚Äôall are doing your own research. I want you guys to ruminate about the negatives because not everything is rainbow and cupcakes.

                So now with all that said this brings me to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). In the context of bio-renewables and feedstocks, the forestry practices highlight the importance of responsible sourcing and management of natural resources. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the world of responsible forestry, both SFI and FSC lay down the law, putting limits on clearcut harvest areas and putting the brakes on turning forests into something they're not supposed to be. These limitations are pretty consistent with the idea that, to maintain environmental sustainability, all feedstocks, including biorenewables, should be sourced within defined limits. It's like setting up green traffic lights for Mother Nature. (Difference between)
            </p>
            <p>
                It gets better, the ethical aspects of feedstock sources are highlighted by the requirement that indigenous people be consulted during the SFI and FSC certification processes. The great awareness that bio-renewables should be obtained while respecting local communities' rights is honestly such a nice a thing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here‚Äôs actually a grid that I had done whilst researching on SFI and FSC. It shows you the comparative information on SFI and FSC. 
            </p>

            (Differences Between)
            <p>
                Both of these groups are not the same but similar they do things they‚Äôre own way but their end goal is to promote a sustainable environment. In essence, the insights from SFI and FSC practices underscore the gravity of responsibly sourcing bio-renewables. They remind us that while innovation is essential, it must be balanced with respect for the natural world and a commitment to sustainable practices.

            <p>
                In a nutshell, bamboo‚Äôs the cool eco-hero in town, with it‚Äôs versatile energy moves. We still have to take into account the risks and issues with monoculture tree plantations, relying and worshiping a hero comes with it‚Äôs risks, if we don‚Äôt consider the full picture, flaws and all. It‚Äôs a reminder that all bio-renewables, like these green energy power-ups, should be sourced responsibly, These are just some things that flew around my head. What are your thoughts on it all?

            <h1>Consumption, resources, and the environment: What you need to know. (Like srsly)</h1>
            by Tenzin Seldom
            <p>
                Alright pay attention family and friends or the general public, did you already know Americans have been using a lot more copper lately? No? Well, between 1963 and 1996, our copper consumption doubled, and then it doubled again two decades later (Lesson 1) ‚Äì talk about a copper craze! Interestingly, a big chunk of the copper we use isn't even from our mines; we're importing it from other countries because it's cheaper. Surprising, right? It turns out we're doing this to be environmentally conscious. People all over the US are saying no to more copper mining because of the potential risks to our environment. When reading about this, I found it a bit confusing at first ‚Äì why not use our mines? But it started making sense after learning that it will have a negative impact on our environment. (Lesson 1) Exploring renewable resources, especially copper, feels like navigating a maze of potential environmental impacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                And speaking of environmental impacts. Let‚Äôs talk about water. While we're all trying to be water-saving heroes, there's a twist. Those innocent-looking dairy cows? They're gulping down nearly 16,000 liters of water to produce one liter of milk. And beef? Hold onto your hat; it takes the same amount of water to make one kilo! So, here's me contemplating a switch to soy milk, which sips on a mere 300 liters. And chocolate? Hold onto your sweet tooth ‚Äì a whopping 17,000 liters for just one kilo! (Lesson 2) The more we learn, the more we're rethinking our beverage and snack choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                We‚Äôre not done yet, we‚Äôve only just begun. In our sustainability stories, we time-travel to societies that struggled to adapt ‚Äì kind of like trying to dance to a new beat without missing a step. Back in the day, everyone was just doing their thing, experimenting like it was one big sustainability test. Fast forward to the Renaissance, when folks started questioning and showing concerns for our world's sustainability. Sadly, those warnings were ignored. (Lesson 1) It makes you wonder ‚Äì what if people had taken it seriously back then? Maybe we'd be living in a more sustainable world right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now when we talk about sustainability we have to take the environment into account. So, THEREFORE, I decided to play weather detective and check out the difference between extreme weather and climate change. It's like comparing a short story to a whole book series ‚Äì both interesting, just on different scales. Imagine extreme weather events as the cool, attention-grabbing moments ‚Äì the short bursts of drama featuring hurricanes and heat waves. Now, climate change is the slow-burning series, the one shaping the entire narrative quietly in the background. Guess who the storytellers are? Yup, it's us, the humans, pulling the strings with our greenhouse gases and fossil fuel choices. It's like we're directing the ultimate weather movie, where nature is the star. Now, let's switch gears to a horror movie analogy. Extreme weather events are the jump scares ‚Äì sudden, heart-pounding moments like hurricanes and floods. Zoom out, and the entire movie is climate change ‚Äì a long, ongoing story influenced by us, the audience. Just like a movie's vibe changes, our weather shifts as climate change takes its time. It's a real-life drama happening globally, giving us a front-row seat to see how it affects communities. Climate change is like the ultimate storyteller, gradually shaping the world over time. To really get what's going on, we need to peel back the layers, like unwrapping a mystery, short-term thrills and long-term sagas working together to give us the full picture of our evolving environment. When we peel back a layer, perhaps, we‚Äôre not just simple audience members but rather a more active member in this horror/mystery/thriller. We as humans have a far greater impact‚Ä¶mayhaps we are the monster lurking in the shadows. (Lesson 5 and Gov, Global Change)
